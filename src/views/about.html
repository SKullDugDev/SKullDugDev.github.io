          class="srOnly">William</span> Edgar Wright is a poet based in Maryland, USA.
        His debut collection, <i>.a period in time</i>, is entirely self published. The collection focuses on the life
        of William over the course of nearly two years and attempts to bring to life the emotions and experiences
        endured during that time. His work entails subjects such as the struggles of mental health and the hardships of
        life and relationships, while resting to appreciate the beauty of the world itself. Capturing the stream of
        consciousness that is the mind's chaos and combinining it with the anchor that is the poetic form, this
        collection is the perfect introduction into the mind of Wright.</p>

      <p class="authorDescription"> William was penned out of a necessity to write and create, but an inability to fully
        access the stories and emotions trapped within the mind, an endless ocean muddied and mucked slow. Stranded and
        stuck searching for an outlet, Wright came to be in those short breaths of sanity that could be called clarity.
        And in those moments when words came, a song waiting to be sung, he etched them down and had them bound in an
        abstract page. Over and over again this ritual was repeated until the voice that is William Edgar Wright truly
        came to fruition with a distinct identity.</p>

      <p class="authorDescription">
        He is an attempt to understand via the lens of poetry, to tell a story that resonates on a level basic to the
        human condition. There is a beauty and comfort to the written word that exists both in the mind and aloud once
        given breath. In an absurdist embrace of the futility of "the right word", William chooses to take you along on
        his journey of self-discovery in the hopes that the paths taken and the worlds described might accomplish
        something. What that is, not even he knows.</p>

      <p class="authorDescription">
        Come along and dive into an exploration of the subjective nature of
        objective truth and test the limits of language in its ability to bring together and describe what may or may
        not be quite there.
